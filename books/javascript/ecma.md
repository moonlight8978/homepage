# ECMA

## ECMA Stage

- Stage 0 **Strawperson**

> initial idea

- Stage 1 **Proposal**

> formal proposal that describes a discrete problem or general need, suggests a shape of the solution and points out potential challenges

- Stage 2 **Draft**

> The draft should describe the syntax, semantics and APIs precisely as much as possible.
>
> An experimental implementation is also needed, runnable by a browser or a build-time transpiler like Babel.

- Stage 3 **Candidate**

> almost final - but ready for feedback and refinements from implementations and users

- Stage 4 **Finished**

> the proposal is ready to be included in the latest draft of the specification - and be delivered with its next edition
