  - Containers are short-lived
  - Recenter the monitoring around layers and tags
  - Monitor all layers of your stack together. The key is that you must be able to see whatâ€™s happening across the layers simultaneously, and determine how problems in one part of the stack ripple to the rest of the stack.
